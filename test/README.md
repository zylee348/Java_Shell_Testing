# Test driven development Test Cases Readme

Note: The test cases provided are from your peers. As such, the assumptions might differ.

## Instructions
1) To use the TDD test cases, you might need to resolve any compilation errors or incompatible implementations. The assumptions and implementation differs across teams.
2) It is not necessary for you to resolve the PMD violations in the TDD test cases; no marks will be deducted for PMD violations in the provided TDD test cases.

## Environment

Some teams may also have changed the `Environment` class name to another name. The `TestEnvironmentUtil` class serves to dynamically load your `Environment` class, through which the test cases can manipulate the working directory. 
It uses the heuristic that the class is renamed to a similar name containing the "Environment" keyword. 
Should `TestEnvironmentUtil` fail to find your `Environment` class, feel free to change its implementation to reference your `Environment` class. 

## Assumptions in TDD test cases:
Your assumptions might differ. Feel free to adjust the provided test cases, or to use your own test cases instead of the provided test cases. If you do not use the provided test cases, do not add them to your project (no marks are deducted if you do not use the provided test cases).
