## ðŸ§© About This Module  

This project was developed as part of a **software testing school module** focused on applying key testing and debugging concepts in **Java**.  

The module covers both fundamental and advanced topics, including:  
- **Unit testing**  
- **Integration testing**  
- **Regression testing**  
- **Testing coverage criteria**  

We also explored various **debugging techniques** to identify the root causes of errors in failing test cases, as well as methods for:  
- **Performance prediction**  
- **Performance clustering**  
- **Performance debugging**  

As part of the hands-on component, we used tools such as:  
- **Randoop** â€“ for automatic unit test generation  
- **JUnit** â€“ for writing and managing structured test cases  
- **Mockito** â€“ for mocking dependencies and verifying interactions  

Through these exercises, we gained practical experience in building reliable software through systematic testing and debugging practices.
