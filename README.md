About This Module

This project was developed as part of a software testing school module focused on applying key testing and debugging concepts in Java. The module covers fundamental and advanced topics such as unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing, along with the study of various testing coverage criteria.

We explored debugging techniques to identify the root cause of errors in failing test cases, as well as methods for performance prediction, performance clustering, and performance debugging.

As part of the hands-on component, we used tools such as Randoop — an automatic unit test generation tool for Java — to design, execute, and analyze test suites. Through these exercises, we gained practical experience in building reliable software through systematic testing and debugging practices.
